# Robles ANA515P
Project 3. Mental Health in Tech. 
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. The orginial dataset is called survey-2.xlsx and the new version is Robles ANA515P.Rmd.
The new version uses RMarkdown and outputs a html document with two visuals- a pie chart and a histogram. 

The pie chart displays the distribution of gender. This visual shows that the gender majority is male. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies acknowledge the limitations this gender gap entails and understands that it might also skew results. 
The histogram provides the distribution of ages in the dataset. This visual shows that the majority of participants were between 20 and 40 years old. In context, the age frequencies might help explain the mental health findings of the study, as different ages/generations experience different priorities and worries.

These variables (Age and Gender) as well as Country and State have been cleaned to provide a cohesive and clear dataset. The dataset also orginially had two sheets, but this code merges them into one.
