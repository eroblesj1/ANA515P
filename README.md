Project 3. Mental Health in Tech. 
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 
The code uses RMarkdown and outputs a html document with two visuals- a pie chart and a histogram. The pie chart displays the distribution of gender. The histogram provides the distribution of ages in the dataset. These variables (Age and Gender) as well as Country and State have been cleaned to provide a cohesive and clear dataset. The dataset also orginially had two sheets, but this code merges them into one.
