Project 3. Mental Health in Tech. 
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. There are two visuals- a pie chart and a histogram. The pie chart displays the distribution of gender. The histogram provides the distribution of ages in the dataset.
The dataset orginially had two sheets, which this code merges into one. The variables Age, Gender, Country, and State have been cleaned to provide a cohesive and clear dataset.
